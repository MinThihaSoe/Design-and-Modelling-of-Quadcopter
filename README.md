# Quadcopter
Trajectory control with Quadcopter in MatLAB using Simulink

This project is reseached for MAE6245 : Robotic Systems course in The George Washington University (2024).

Each Simulation is separated into different files

Open the quad_sim.slx to and run the simulation.
Make sure the directory at the MATLAB is the same as the file of the quad_sim.slx
